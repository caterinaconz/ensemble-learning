# Ensemble Learning Project

In this repository you can find my team's work for our Ensamble Learning course projects. 
* Project A: Cyberbullying Classification - for the first project we worked on a dataset containing more than 47000 tweets labelled according to the class of cyberbullying with the aim of creating a multi-classification model to predict cyberbullying type, implementing a binary classification model to flag potentially harmful tweet and exploring words and patterns associated with each type of cyberbullying.

* Project B: for this project, the task assigned was to build a Regression and a Classification Decision Trees from scratch.
